# 📊 Viewership Data Analysis

This repository contains viewership data for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using **Python, PySpark, and Databricks**. The dataset provides insights into customer engagement, platform usage, and video consumption patterns.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following fields:

* **DateID** – Date of activity (YYYYMMDD format)
* **CustomerID** – Unique identifier for each customer
* **TotalTimeWatched** – Total viewing time (in seconds/minutes)
* **Platform** – Device or platform used (e.g., mobile, web, TV)
* **PlayEventType** – Type of playback event (e.g., play, pause, stop)
* **VideoTitle** – Title of the video watched

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Clean and preprocess raw viewership data
* Identify and remove missing values and duplicates
* Perform customer-level analysis (e.g., engagement trends, active users)
* Create time-series visualizations of watch behavior
* Explore insights using Databricks notebooks

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Databricks** – Cloud-based data analysis and visualization
* **PySpark** – Scalable data processing
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data wrangling and manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

In the next phase, visual analysis and advanced insights will be developed once graph plotting in Databricks has been fully implemented.

Would you like me to also add a **section with your data quality findings** (e.g., “118,534 records, 15,828 duplicates, 928 distinct customers, no missing values”) so that it reflects the work you’ve already done?
