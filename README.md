## OVERVIEW
# 📊 Viewership Data Analysis
This repository contains viewership data for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using **Python, and Databricks**. The dataset provides insights into customer engagement, platform usage, and video consumption patterns.
## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
**DateID** – Date of activity (YYYYMMDD format)

**CustomerID** – Unique identifier for each customer

**TotalTimeWatched** – Total viewing time (in seconds/minutes)

**Platform** – Device or platform used (e.g., mobile, web, TV)

**PlayEventType** – Type of playback event (e.g., play, pause, stop)

**VideoTitle** – Title of the video watched

## 🎯 Purpose
* Clean and preprocess raw viewership data
* Identify and remove missing values and duplicates
* Perform customer-level analysis (e.g., engagement trends, active users)
* Create time-series visualizations of watch behavior
* Explore insights using Databricks notebooks
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
**Databricks** – Cloud-based data analysis and visualization

**Pandas & NumPy** – Data wrangling and manipulation

**Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization - to be used visuals in the next phase

## 🚀 Next Steps
In the next phase, visual analysis and advanced insights will be developed once graph plotting in Databricks has been fully implemented.
